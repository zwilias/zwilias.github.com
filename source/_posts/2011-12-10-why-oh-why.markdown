The other day, I ran across the blog of another KHLeuven student, 
[Dylan Meeus' blog](http://it-ca.net/blogdylan/) that is. Aside from that blog
being the complete inverse of mine (he's doing everything in GUI's on microsoft
tools on windows, whereas I'm doing everything on the CLI on BSD tools on a mac)
, one thing caught my attention. Specifically, a 
[blog post about "quick" filerenaming](http://it-ca.net/blogdylan/?p=29). 
Basically, a friend of his, who apparently works for a game development company,
needed a quick way to rename a bunch of files to -1.jpg -> -n.jpg. And 
apparently, he needed help doing that. So Dylan wrote him an application (in VB)
to do this job for him.

<!--more-->

For reference, here's the complete code:

``` vbnet
Dim s As String
Dim Filepath As String
Dim n As Double
n = 1
Dim m As String
m = "-"
Dim ns As String
Dim nname As String

Dim p As String

Filepath = "C:\Thoughtwire\"

s = Dir(Filepath, vbDirectory)

Do While Len(s)

    If s <> "." And s <> ".." Then

        ns = m & n
        nname = ns & ".jpg"
        torename.Text = torename.Text + s
        My.Computer.FileSystem.RenameFile("C:\Thoughtwire\" & s, nname)
        n = n + 1
    End If

    s = Dir()
Loop
```

So what's the problem then?

Well, it just irks me. Several things about this just irk me. For one, this guy
works at a game-development company and can't figure this out for himself or ask
any of his collegues. Worse yet, when someone finally helps the guy out, he ends
up with a Visual Basic program. But perhaps the worst thing about all of this,
is how simply this could've been solved in a shell language leveraging some UNIX
tools. For example, the equivalent of the above abomination:

``` bash
c=1; for f in *; do mv "$f" "-$c.jpg"; let c=c+1; done
```

... But no, they come up with a Visual Basic program. Ugh. Why, oh, why?
