### First off ###

Hello, world! Seeing as how this is my first real blogpost ever, I figure that was mandatory.

Now that that's out of the way...

### Preface ###

Like most people who like fiddling with things - and more often than not, breaking them along the way - I occasionally come into contact with the terminal. Be it to simply run some command that don't have a graphical interface, simply to play around with a world where everything is basically text, or because I feel a CLI allows me to do certain things faster, more efficient. 

As such, I'm going to do a little experiment.

### The Experiment ###

It's really quite simple: use my computer the way I usually do, but instead of using graphical interfaces, do it on the commandline.

There's a certain temptation to simply say I'm trying to find command-line replacements for my regular applications and using those instead, but that's missing the point. My goal is to use the command-line as a command-line, not merely a replacement. Find alternative workflows, find better, faster, more time-efficient ways of doing things. And during all of that: learn. Become used to having your hands on your keyboard, using that to navigate my computer, my documents, my code, the internet.


### First babysteps ###
And this blogpost right here, is my first step in that direction. I created, edited, previewed and deployed (published, in blogtalk) this post entirely on the command-line, using tools such as `rake` - the ruby equivalent of `make` (this blog is powered by [octopress](http://octopress.org/), a blog-aware static site generator built on top of jekyll, written in ruby), `vim` - a powerful (or so I hear) commandline text-editor, `links` - a commandline browser, great tool for usability testing, too, and once more, a `rake` task.

I've ran into `rake` before, and I've used `links` for commandline browsing before as well. Never before, though, have I had the guts to dive into `vim`, head-first. Guiding me through this journey of sorts is a fun little blogpost by [Yann Esposito](http://yannesposito.com/ "Yann's homepage") titled [Learn Vim Progressively](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/) - an excellent startingpoint (I hope) for anyone looking to get into `vim`. I'm still at the survival stage, but honestly, it's going pretty fast. Not used to navigating text in this manner yet, but I figure I'll stick with it - certainly can't hurt.

I'll be trying to write regular posts on my experiences and my progress. More to follow.
